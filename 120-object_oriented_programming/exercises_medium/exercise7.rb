# How could you change the method name below so that the method name 
# is more clear and less repetitive.


class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.light_information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end

end

# now call the class method will like Light.light_information, it's repetitive.
# when naming class method, don't include the class name.

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
